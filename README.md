# Hello-world!
Practicing cos I'm a newbie

Hello readers, I started programming at around sophomore year at the age of 15 and dabble a little bit of C# programming, Unity platforming, and digital art.

Right now, I'm pretty new to Github and also started stackoverflow to get a sense of what it's like to program and create some cool projects. Hopefully, I'll experience some cool styles of programming.

Thanks for reading!
